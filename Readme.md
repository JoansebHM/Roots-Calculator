### Instructions

- Download and extract the Parcial2 folder. 

- Inside the virtual environment, you will find an image, the program code, and the requirements to avoid problems with incompatible versions.

- In the console, type the following command: `pip install -r 'Requirements.txt'` to install all the libraries that I have used for this project.

- When you click the "Guardar Reporte" (Save Report) button for the first time, a folder named "Reportes" (Reports) is created, where your report will be in PDF format with the graph and the data obtained in each method.

- The folder is created automatically and will be located inside the Parcial2 folder.

- Each time you click the save button, the program will overwrite the previous file, so you will always have the latest generated PDF.

### Interface

- This project allows you to solve the equation by any method(Steffensen, Newton Raphson, Bisection, rough estimate, fake rule, secant), graph It and also generate a report of the solutions you have in real time
